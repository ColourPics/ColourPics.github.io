Because book prices are a bit wishy washy and I usually buy second hand I've not included prices on these ones but obviously I would encourage buying used books if you can find them, 
I prefer [Awesome Books](https://www.awesomebooks.com/), and I can usually find everything I want on there for a reasonable price.
