# Baking Master List

[BA001](BA001.md) - All-Purpose Enriched Bread; a strange hybrid of Brioche and Japanese Milk Bread, maybe a bit too sticky to do by hand but I have managed once or twice.

[BA002](BA002.md) - Pistachio Buns; based on the above recipie, fucking fantastic for breakfasts.

[BA003](BA003.md) - Burger Buns; again, based on the enriched bread recipie. A right old faff but worth it if you want to make your own.

[BA004](BA004.md) - Banana Bread; like all other banana bread recipies, this one stretches the definition of 'bread', good use of old bananas though.
