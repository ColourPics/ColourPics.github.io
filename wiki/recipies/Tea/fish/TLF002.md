### Ingredients (1 Serving)
- 2 tbsp ghee or neutral oil
- 1 tsp coriander seeds (optional)
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds (optional)
- 6 dried whole round red chiles, preferably Dundicut
- 1 medium Spanish onion, or white, finely chopped
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp kashmiri red chile powder
- 4 medium plum tomatoes, chopped
- 1 tsp fine sea salt
- 1½ pounds firm, skinless white fish, such as cod or haddock, cut into 3-inch​【𝟳.𝟲 𝗰𝗺】 pieces
- Juice of 1 medium lemon, about 60ml
- 2 chopped Thai green chiles
- 5cm piece of ginger, peeled and julienned
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

### Method
 - Heat oven to 200 degrees.
 
 - Add the oil to a large sheet pan and use a single tortilla to smear the oil around. Add the remaining tortillas, spacing them out evenly. Divide the cheese among the tortillas, then sprinkle with as much chile powder as you’d like. Top with the corn, if using.
 
 - Bake the quesadillas until the cheese is melted, 5 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Using a spatula, fold each tortilla over itself to make half moons. Sprinkle with salt and return to the oven until crispy and lightly browned at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.

 - Serve immediately with any desired toppings.
