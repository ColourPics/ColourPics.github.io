### Ingredients (2 Servings)

- 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil

### Ingredients (1 Serving)
- 250g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil
- 1 minced fresh lemongrass stalk
- 1 small shallot, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 Thai red chile, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- ½ teaspoon granulated sugar


### Method
- In a medium bowl, season the chicken with pepper and toss to coat.

- In a medium wok or skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add the chicken and toss until golden all over, about 5 minutes.

- Push the seared chicken aside, making space in the pan, reduce heat to medium-high and add the lemongrass, shallot, garlic and chile. Stir the aromatics together until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then stir to combine them with the chicken.

- Add the fish sauce and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and chicken is cooked through and caramelized, about 3 minutes. Serve over rice.
