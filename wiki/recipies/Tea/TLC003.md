### Ingredients (4 Servings)
- 1.5kg chicken
-  80ml grapefruit juice, freshly squeezed, if possible
- 85g honey
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme

### Method
- Heat the oven to 190 degrees. Pat the chicken dry and season it well with salt and pepper, both inside and out. Place the chicken breast-side up in a 10-inch cast-iron or ovenproof skillet.

- In a medium bowl, whisk together the grapefruit juice, honey, curry powder and thyme. Spoon all the mixture over the chicken, making sure it is evenly covered.

- Roast the chicken for 30 minutes, basting every 15 minutes or so. Turn heat down to 170 degrees and continue basting the chicken with the pan juices until the skin is lacquered with sauce and the chicken registers 73 degrees with an instant thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh, about 45 to 50 minutes more. If skin is starting to become too dark, tent with foil. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
