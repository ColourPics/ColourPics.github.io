# Chicken for Burritos
Source: /u/yellowjacquet

### Ingredients
- 450g boneless skinless chicken thighs, or sub chicken breasts
- 60ml lime juice
- 60ml olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoon onion powder
- 2 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon black pepper

### Instructions

Combine all ingredients of the marinade and mix. Trim excess fat from the chicken thighs and place in a zip bag or airtight container with the marinade. Marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours before cooking, I typically marinate mine overnight.

Preheat a smoker or oven to 250 °F​【𝟭𝟮𝟭°𝗖】. If using an oven, place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil (if available, if not just a rimmed baking sheet will do). If using a smoker, place directly on the grill grates. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, and the internal temp reaches 165 °F​【𝟳𝟰°𝗖】, about 1 to 2 hours. If desired, brush on excess marinade mixture partway through.
