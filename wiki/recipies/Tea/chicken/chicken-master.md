# Chicken Master List

[TLC001](TLC001.md) - Chicken with Spicy Corn; easy peasy sheet pan meal, easy enough to morph into meal prep too.

[TLC002](TLC002.md) - Chicken Fricassee; proper old world cooking, bit fatty though.

[TLC003](TLC003.md) - Curried Roast Chicken; Nice alternative to the standard salt and pepper chicken, but oviously a bit shit with gravy.

[TLC004](TLC004.md) - Chimichurri Chicken; Fantastic recipie, shame that freezing is a bit of a non starter.

[TLC005](TLC005.md) - Honey Garlic Chicken; Another solid meal prep staple, good with rice but better in burritos imho.

[TLC006](TLC006.md) - Chicken Paprikash; Hungarian staple, make sure you have plenty of paprika.

[TLC007](TLC007.md) - Lemongrass Chicken; One of my favorites, though it does suck to be around if you don't like fish sauce.

[TLC008](TLC008.md) - White Chicken Chili; Lower calorie chili. Beans belong in chili.

[TLC009](TLC009.md) - Chicken and Mushroom; Standard pie filling, see ####

[TLC010](TLC010.md) - Chicken Marengo; The Napoleon special, feels very Italian.

[TLC011](TLC011.md) - Spicy Sesame Noodles;
