### Ingredients (4 Servings)
- 2L chicken broth
- 500g boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 4 celery stalks, leaves reserved and stalks thinly sliced
- 180g jasmine rice (unrinsed)
- 60g resh parsley leaves
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus up to 120ml lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons)
- 1 small garlic clove
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 

### Method
- In a large Dutch oven or pot, combine the broth, chicken, celery and rice. Season lightly with salt. (Some broths have more salt than others, so start easy.) Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the rice starts to break down and lose its shape, 20 to 30 minutes.

- Meanwhile, finely chop together the parsley leaves, lemon zest and up to ½ cup​【𝟭𝟭𝟴 𝗺𝗟】 celery leaves. Transfer to a small bowl, grate the garlic clove into the bowl, season with salt and stir to combine.

- Using tongs, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a medium bowl. Using two forks, shred the chicken into pieces, then stir it back into the soup. Remove from heat, stir in the butter (if using), and season to taste with salt. Stir in the lemon juice a little at a time until the soup is bright but still tastes like chicken. (You may not use the full ½ cup​【𝟭𝟭𝟴 𝗺𝗟】 juice.)

- Divide the soup among bowls and top with the parsley-lemon mixture. (The soup, minus the lemon juice and parsley mixture, can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; the rice will absorb liquid as it sits, so add more chicken broth when reheating. Add the lemon juice and fresh herb garnish just before serving.)
