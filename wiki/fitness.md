# My "Fitness" Routine

**I'll preface this with the standard disclaimer: I am not a dietician/PT/physician, you should always consult the relevant people when undertaking any physical training and for fucks sake don't hurt yourself.**

As I'm sure has been said by other people, how you train is going to change dramatically depending on who you are and what goals you're aiming for, but I'll provide a guide to what *I* do here. My goals are to maintain my strength while on hrt, grow my glutes and thighs as much as possible to cut a more feminine figure, and to maintain as much joint health as possible for climbing and hiking.

I am 83kg, 181cm, and 27 y/o. Your milage *will* vary.

## Diet
**Please skip this section if you've had a history of eating disorders, I am not the person you'll want to talk to if this is the case for you, please speak to a doctor**

You're not going to see any results from any strength training or cardio if you don't have a good handle on your diet, there are millions of snake oil salesman trying to sell you their magic cure to make you skinny/buff/whatever but it's a pretty simple matter of calrories in calories out, while this sentace is glossing over a lot of nuance for a good majority of people this is all you need to worry about.

First things first if you want to gain any muscle and/or lose any weight you'll need to get a good estimate of your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure), this can be done through a smart watch (I know Garmin will do this, I assume the others will too), through a calorie tracking app, or through hand calculation.

I usually recommend [Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for calorie tracking as I find its estimates are pretty accurate to what I find in the real world, just be honest with the questions it asks and it should spit out a good TDEE estimate. From here you can set up deficits and surpluses to gain/lose weight, just don't be too extreme, gain weight too fast and you'll put it all on as fat, lose too fast and you'll lose muscle mass and feel like shit. I rarely go over 0.5 kg/week surplus or deficit and imho neither should you unless you know what you're doing.

[The literature](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/fo/c5fo01530h) suggests between 1 and 1.6g of protein per kilo of bodyweight depending on activity level, I aim for the upper bound of this target (so for me 83*1.6 = 133g) this will enable sufficient muscle gain for most people, the remainder of my diet consists of the standard Chronometer recommendations (at time of writing 348g carbs, and 92g fat). The only other metric you should pay proper attention to is fibre, please God make sure you have enough fibre in your diet, most people don't and [some literature](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/dietary-fibre-in-europe-current-state-of-knowledge-on-definitions-sources-recommendations-intakes-and-relationships-to-health/B263D1D7B3440DC9D6F68E23C2B4212F) suggests it's one of the biggest health problems in the western world right now. I aim for 38g/day but you'll need to ramp yourself up to that over time lest you shit your brains out, adjusting from no fibre to lots is a bit of a lurch.

Other than general targets just try to maintain a healthy relationship with food, there is no good food or bad food, just stuff that fits within your diet well and stuff that doesn't, as long as you're eating within your calorie goal you should see the results you want.

### Drinking Calories
Sodas/fizzy drinks/pop is one of the easiest swaps you can make to get a lower calorie intake, most big brands these days mkae a zero sugar version of their product with a pretty similar flavour. As with everything I'm not saying you can't drink full fat sodas, but the bulk of youre intake should be sugar free if thats your thing. **Zero calorie sodas are the only weight loss cheat code I know of**

I have the kind of figure that could easily be described as "goes to the gym, but will not say no to a drink", Alhoholic drinks have more calrories than you think so if your're the type to enjoy a drink just be careful about your intake for calorie reasons as well as general health reasons, modern literature supports the line ["No level of alcohol consumption is safe"](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health) and you should follow this line as well as you are able. This is very much a do as I say not as I do situation, I'm well aware I sound like a hypocrite during this paragraph but this is a risk I choose to take, you judge for yourself.

### Veganism/Vegitarianism
I'm sure some people will want to explore this side of things, I am neither a Vegan nor a Vegitarian and never have been. Therefore I'll leave it to other people to talk on this subject, I can't provide any good reccomendations for literature on this topic so youll have to do your own research.
I can, however reccomend [One: Pot, Pan, Planet.](https://www.waterstones.com/book/one-pot-pan-planet/anna-jones/9780008172480) for vegitarian recipies, though it does have a heavy focus on seasonality in the UK.

### Ozempic and other weight loss drugs
I am not a doctor, I will not comment on this.

## Exercise

I firmly belive that everyone should do some form of resistance training, you can keep this to solely bodyweight exercises if you like but you'll be limited on the results you'll get, including long term joint health results. **Squat now so you can stand up when you're 80.**

### On "getting bulky"
Many many many femminine presenting people I have talked to regarding strength training have expressed a worry about "getting bulky", citing examples of prefessional female body builders or rugby players. Unless it is your goal, **You will not get "bulky"**, getting anywhere close to "bulky" is a deliberate choice that takes years of strength training and a very particular diet, most people will not even see those results in their lifetime let alone by accident.

The particular example I like to cite is Patty (@leanbeefpatty on insta), whose job it is to be fit yet she still absolutely cuts a feminine figure, she attined her pysique through years of hard work so thinking that you'll get that big by accident is ridiculous.

### Cardio
Cardio is very much a case of finding the one that works for you, my partner runs pretty religiously but I can't stand it. Cycling happens to work for me but unfortunately it probably won't for you, shop around and find the one that you find the least objectionable and stick with it.

I usually try to stick to about 20-30 minutes of cardio per day, usually in the form of cycling to and from uni and work, on top of this I aim for the classic 10,000 steps daily. I find this target relatively easy with the lifestyle I have but naturally the walkability of your neighborhood will make this much harder if you're unlucky, there is absolutely no same in just going to the gym to walk on a treadmill, any exercise is better than no exercise.

### Strength Training
For tracking strength training I reccomend [Repcount](https://www.repcountapp.com/), you can do this with a pen and paper situation but personally I find something on my phone far more convenient. You should always be aiming to improve on the last time you performed a particular exercise, in addition you should be training close to failure as much as is possible, this is where you will see muscle hypertophy and growth. 

When starting out you should find a weight that puts you at the limit of your ability within the rep range with good form, once you have reached a point where you can complete the programmed exercise to the upper bound of its rep range increase the weight enough to challenge you within the rep range again, rinse and repeat. This is known as "progressive overload", and it is more or less the only way to increase strength.
