## Recipies

Hello and welcome to the recipe book! I wrote this more just to collect all the disparate sources I use for recipes in one place where I can easily find them, the bulk of these recipes are relatively low cal/high protein but there is plenty of variety to chose from. 
 Unfortunately it does kind of rely on you being somewhat familiar with cooking terms, but there's nothing too out there, these are recipes that I eat in the day to day and a couple of more fancy ones, not a Michelin star card catalogue.
 Between living in shared accommodation and falling in love with someone that likes different food to me, most of the cooking I've done to this point has been for just myself, as such, all recipes are presented in their original form and as a single person/single serving version, where applicable. 

In an effort to make it easy to actually find what I'm/You're looking for I've instituted a number reference system similar to a warehouse:

Recipes are referenced by category:
 - Breakfast - BR
 - Lunch/Tea - TL (I'm Welsh so I use Tea to refer to evening meal (Dinner))
 - Dessert - DE
 - Sides & Snacks - SN
 - [Baking - BA](/cooking/baking/baking-master.md)
 
 And then by protein:
  - Chicken - C
  - Beef - B
  - Pork - P
  - Fish - F
  - Shellfish - S
  - Vegetarian - V
  - Vegan - G
  - Other - O

And finally a reference number to differentiate within categories
For example: TLC001 (Chicken with Spicy Corn) will be under Tea & Lunch (TL), and Chicken (C).

Feel free to add more! I just ask that you follow the format presented and use the reference system.
